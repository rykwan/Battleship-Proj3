# Battleship-Proj3
Battleship game for command line built using C++, for CS32


The major classes are Board, Game, and Player. HumanPlayer, GoodPlayer, MediocrePlayer, and AwfulPlayer inherit from Player's base class. GoodPlayer is a Computer Player that implements my own MiniMax and probability algorithm to attack (beats MediocrePlayer ~96% of the time). MediocrePlayer uses recursion to place its ships.
